# Video Tutorials Portfolio

Welcome to my video tutorials portfolio! This folder contains a curated collection of technical video content I have created for a range of clients and industries, including aerospace engineering and cryptocurrency exchanges.

Here you’ll find original scripts, supporting documentation, and direct links to the published YouTube videos. Each subfolder focuses on a different project, such as Collier Aerospace’s HyperX software and BloFin’s cryptocurrency exchange platform.

All scripts and videos were written, produced, and narrated by me, with a focus on making complex technical topics clear, engaging, and actionable for end users.

## Contents

- **Collier Aerospace** – Training and product feature videos for HyperX, aimed at stress engineers.
- **BloFin** – Platform overview and feature tutorials for a cryptocurrency exchange.

Please explore the project folders to view specific work samples.
