## BloFin Cryptocurrency Exchange

This section features my freelance technical writing and video production work for BloFin, a cryptocurrency exchange. I created original scripts and produced video tutorials outlining the platform’s key features and capabilities. My documentation and videos were designed to help users confidently navigate BloFin’s trading interface, understand its account structure, and take full advantage of its spot, futures, and funding products. These resources showcase my ability to communicate complex financial technology concepts in an engaging and user-friendly format.
