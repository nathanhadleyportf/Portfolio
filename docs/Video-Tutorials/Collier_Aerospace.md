## Collier Aerospace

This section highlights my technical writing work for Collier Aerospace, where I produced user guides, training materials, and video tutorials for advanced engineering software. My documentation and videos were specifically designed for stress engineers using **HyperX**, Collier Aerospaceâ€™s powerful structural analysis tool. All video scripts were original and both written and produced by me. These resources demonstrate my ability to translate complex aerospace concepts and workflows into clear, accessible materials for engineers and product users. My work supported both internal teams and external customers, focusing on usability, accuracy, and real-world application.


Below is a small sample of the many many videos I made for them over the 2+ years I worked for Collier Aerospace:
