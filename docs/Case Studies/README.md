## Case Studies

This section contains a selection of one-pager case studies that I developed as part of targeted social media campaigns. Each case study is designed to quickly showcase real-world results, solutions, or success stories in a concise, visually engaging format.

These case studies were created for use as social media posts and digital collateral, aiming to highlight key outcomes and spark interest among prospective clients and industry peers. Their one-page style ensures they are easily shareable and digestible, making them effective tools for thought leadership and lead generation during campaign cycles.
