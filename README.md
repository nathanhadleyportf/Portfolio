Welcome to my technical writing portfolio, crafted to showcase my expertise across diverse domains — including API documentation, cloud platforms, and aerospace engineering. This repository is fully integrated with **MkDocs** and GitHub Actions to enable a seamless **CI/CD workflow**, allowing for continuous updates, auto-deployment, and developer-style version control.

## What’s Inside

This portfolio includes:

- **API Docs** — Clear, structured documentation tailored for developers
- **Case Studies** — Real-world examples highlighting my approach to solving complex documentation challenges
- **Video Tutorials** — Educational walkthroughs on technical topics
- **eBooks** — In-depth guides covering Cloud Computing, RPA, Digital Identity, and more

Each section reflects my deep commitment to usability, accuracy, and accessibility in technical content.

## Built with MkDocs + CI/CD

This portfolio is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org), a static site generator. The CI/CD pipeline is powered by **GitHub Actions**, which:

- Rebuilds the site automatically on every commit
- Deploys the generated content to the `gh-pages` branch
- Instantly updates the live portfolio via GitHub Pages

## About Me

I’m a seasoned Technical Writer with 10+ years of experience in aerospace engineering and cloud-based platforms. I specialize in developer-focused content and docs-as-code workflows. I hold a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech and am continuously expanding my skill set — including recent PCEP certification and upcoming enrollment in Georgia Tech’s Python bootcamp.
