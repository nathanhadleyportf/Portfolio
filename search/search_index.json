With a Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech, I combine deep technical expertise with a passion for making complex concepts accessible through well-structured user manuals, API references, tutorials, and release notes.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have collaborated closely with engineering, UX, and product teams in agile environments to deliver developer-centric documentation that enhances product usability and streamlines onboarding. I am proficient in modern documentation tools such as Markdown, Paligo, MadCap Flare, and Git, and skilled in integrating docs-as-code workflows with CI/CD pipelines.</p> <p>My experience spans diverse industries\u2014from aerospace giants like Lockheed Martin and Delta Air Lines to cloud-based platforms and enterprise systems. I have a proven track record of managing version-controlled content, creating SOPs, and supporting compliance documentation, always focused on accuracy and clarity.</p> <p>Beyond technical writing, I bring a strong background in aerospace engineering, including stress analysis and FAA-compliant documentation, which allows me to bridge the gap between engineering teams and end users effectively.</p> <p>I am passionate about continuous learning and leveraging technology to improve documentation quality and accessibility. Whether producing detailed engineering guides or mentoring technical communities, I strive to empower users and teams through exceptional communication. </p>"},{"location":"#continuous-learning","title":"Continuous Learning","text":"<p>I am deeply committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of technology and technical communication. Recently, I earned the PCEP (Python Certified Entry-Level Programmer) certification to strengthen my programming skills and better support modern software documentation needs.</p> <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to further enhance my Python expertise by enrolling in Georgia Tech\u2019s Flex Bootcamp this fall. This rigorous program will deepen my development capabilities, enabling me to bridge the gap between technical writing and software engineering more effectively.</p> <p>By continuously expanding my skill set, I aim to deliver even more valuable, precise, and developer-friendly documentation that meets the evolving demands of technology teams and end users.</p>"},{"location":"API-Docs/","title":"Overview","text":""},{"location":"API-Docs/#api-documentation-samples","title":"API Documentation Samples","text":"<p>All API documentation examples in this section are original, hypothetical samples created for demonstration purposes.
